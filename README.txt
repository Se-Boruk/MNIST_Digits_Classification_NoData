This is Mnist classification without any data. Using MNIST dataset
for training is prohibited.

Acc Score on kaggle test set = 0,66

Model MobileNet was downloaded and cut to middle layers, then
PCA and k-means algorithm determined clusters from tensor.

As K-means do not recognize classes but group them I grouped them manually,
if you want to run the set by yourself you may have to adjust it in label
dictionary.
